Day3 JavaScript:

ques 1) Write the Code for all Data types.
   
          1)  Number 
          2)  String
          3) Undefined
          4) Null
          5) Boolean

 1)  Number :- Contains all numerical numbers. 
         let a=45;
         let b=89;
         let c= a+b;
      console.log(c);//134

2) String :- Set of character which must have single or double quotes.
     let x="Nikita"
     let y="Patil";
     let z=x+y;
    console.log(z);//Nikita Patil

3) Undefined :- Variables are declared but not assign any values or intialize. 
        var d;// it doesn't return any thing else only store or take space into the memory.
       console.log(d);// Undefined

4) Null :- When any value assign as a null.
      var f=null;
  console.log(f);//Null

5) Boolean :- In this, all values are in 0 or 1 form i.e. true or false respectively.
  var bool=false;
  console.log(bool);//false
 typeof bool;
 'Boolean'

typeof  operator is used to get which type of data type is here used.


Ques 2) What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?
     Operators: - Operators in js are the symbols that peroform operations on variables and their values.
                       - Opreands are used to perform operations in javascript.
                       - They allow you to manipulate and work with data in various ways.
1) Arithematics Operator
2) Assignment Operator
3) Logical Operator
4) Comparision Operator


Ques 3) Explain the Assignment Operator.
ans.. - It is used to assign a value to a variable.
        - It take value on right hand side and stores it in the variable on its left hand side.
         - Right hand side is perform firstly.
         - Symbol of assignment operator is"=".
let variable = value;

let a=10;
let b="hello";
    if(a==b)
    {
   console.log("a is equal to b");
} else
  { console.log("not equal and b");
}


Ques 4) Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.
ans.. Arithmtic operator are the +,-,*,**,%,/ 
let a=10;
let b=3;
  let sum=a+b;
     console.log(sum);//13
 let differenece=a-b;
    console.log(difference);//7
 let product=a*b;
    console.log(product);//30
 let mod=a % b;
    console.log(difference);//1
 let exponential=a**b;
    console.logexponential);//1000
let div=a/b;
 console.log(div);//3.3


Ques 5) What are the Binary Operators in js.
ans... -  Binary Operator are that operator on two oprands.
         - Binary Operator atleast have two oprands to perform operations.
         - They perform arithmatic, comparision, assignment, logical operations.
 

Ques 6) Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.
ans.. - pre-inccrement:- symbol is "++variable".
         - the variable is increased by 1 before it cuurent value used in this expression.
       -   fisrt increase then use.

ex= let num=5;
        let res=++num;
    console.log(num);//6
console.log(res);//6

 - post-inccrement:- symbol is "variable++".
         -  the current value of the variable is used in an expression, and then the variable is increased by 1.
       -   fisrt use then update.

ex= let num=5;
        let res=num++;
    console.log(num);//6
console.log(res);//5
